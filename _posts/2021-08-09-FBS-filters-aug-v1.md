## Phase
    Live

## Audience
- UserTesting Generic Panel * 15 people

## We were focusing on 
Test new filter types and categories with the users and understand if these will work for them. 
Do this as a Closed Card Sort whih gives people categories and asks them to place items into them 
Follow this up with an Open Card Sort where people can chosse their own groupings

We explored the following things: 

- If the 5 filter category's make sense? 
- If the items listed under each of the 5 filter category's make sense? 
- If users want an "All Scotland“ as an option under the "I am located in" category? 
- Thoughts on the language used for categories 
- If there was anything missing from the filter categories or the items under the categories.


## What we discovered
- They did not work that well for users
