## Phase
    Live

## Audience
- UserTesting Generic Panel * 15 people

## We were focusing on 
Test new filter types and categories with the users and understand if these will work for them. 
Do this as a Closed Card Sort whih gives people categories and asks them to place items into them 
Follow this up with an Open Card Sort where people can chosse their own groupings

We explored the following things: 

- If the 5 filter category's make sense? 
- If the items listed under each of the 5 filter category's make sense? 
- If users want an "All Scotlandâ€œ as an option under the "I am located in" category? 
- Thoughts on the language used for categories 
- If there was anything missing from the filter categories or the items under the categories.


## What we discovered
- They did not work that well for users

## What we discovered 

| Learning
| ---
| ðŸ’¡**lightbulb moment**
| The **Grouping Headings  did not work that well** for users
| The **items** listed within the groups **did make sense**
| The term "Outwith Scotland" was ambiguous and may only be well understood within Scotland
| The Language was fairly good but potentially ambiguous
| Users Confused **"I am looking for"** and **"I am looking for support with"**
| From teh open card sort; 3 main categories emerged. Region, Support, Sector or Business Type

## ðŸŽ§ QuotesÃŸ

| Everything was clear but I was unsure about the â€˜Outwith Scotland' 
| Where items can be placed in to two categories: Education, training as an example, give the option for them to sit within both.
| I would have to say that some of these were a bit vague but overall, It wasn't that difficult for me to sort them in groups once I started working on this task
