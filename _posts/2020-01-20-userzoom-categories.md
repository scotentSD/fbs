**Summary of insights**

### Discovery - About Us and “Programme” category feedback (15 users) ###


- All 15 users would find an “about us” section helpful and majority would like to see this section on the website
- They felt that some introductory information about what’s on offer on this website and which organisations are involved in this would benefit them
- When asked about “type of support” options, majority (13 out of 15) said that they understand these options and “programmes” category made sense.

### Events map function (10 users) ###

- Users were easily able to locate the events and the map feature; however, some were expecting an events tab / button on the homepage.
- Majority (8 out of 10) were able to find the specific Glasgow event and most users found it easy to find it on the map.
- Specifically talking about the icons 4 out 6 found it difficult to understand what the different icons meant – users were unsure about the colours, they wanted a key / legend.

### News and update prototype (10 users) ###
- All users found the “news and updates” section helpful and majority would like to see this section on the website
