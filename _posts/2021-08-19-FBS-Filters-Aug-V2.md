## Phase
- Live

## Audience
- UserTesting Generic Panel * 15 people
 - 9 Female
 - 6 Male

## We were focusing on 
Test new filter types and categories with the users and understand if these will work for them. 
Do this as a Closed Card Sort whih gives people categories and asks them to place items into them 
Follow this up with an Open Card Sort where people can chosse their own groupings

We explored the following things: 

- If the filter category's make sense? 
- If the items listed under each of the filter category's make sense? 
- If users want an "All Scotlandâ€œ as an option under the "I am located in" category? 
- Thoughts on the language used for categories 
- If there was anything missing from the filter categories or the items under the categories.



## What we discovered
| Learning
| ---
| They broadly made sense to users
| There was some overlap
| **All Scotland** was welcomed under '**I am Located In**'
| The Language ws fairly straightforward
| **'I operate in**' and **'I amd looking for support with'** were ambiguous, and where most of teh overlap occured


## ðŸ§°  We Changed  

| Change
| ---
| We iterated to another set of Group Headings
| Decided to make teh headings sentences
| Decided to make the headings questions
