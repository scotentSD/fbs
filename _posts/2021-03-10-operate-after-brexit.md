## Audience
- 4 potential customers, using Video calls (Microsoft Teams)
- 4 UserZoom un-moderated sessions

## What we tested
- The Operate after Brexit test page - https://findbusinesssupport.gov.scot/operate-after-brexit-test-page

## Focus
- What challenges are businesses facing around trying to operate after Brexit?
- Where would businesses go for information about operating a business after Brexit?
- What do users think of the content and layout of the page?
- Is there anything missing from the page?
- What would users do if they came to this page and couldn't find the information that they needed?

## Summary of insights

- The site and page are quite clear
- Not everyone agreed on the top three "Top questions"
- The accordions worked fine but some key information is hidden in them
- "Funding" was missed by most people as it is so far down the page, but funding is of interest
- Top Brexit issues mentioned include increased costs, supply chain issues, taxes/paperwork and employing EU staff
- Upon failure, people are split between going back to Google or the contact us page
- Some businesses are still unsure how Brexit is going to affect them

## Recommendations
- Consider making content about people, workforce and skills and FAQs more prominent
- Consider moving the Funding button up higher – but only if there is going to be relevant funding for businesses to apply for. Otherwise this will lead to a poor customer journey.
- Review the top questions and possibly check to see if we have any data to see if these are actually the top things we get asked about, or consider moving this section below the accordions
