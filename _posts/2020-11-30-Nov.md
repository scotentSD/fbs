2. V2 has buttons that lead to the Filtered View.

### V1 Comments
- I think it was more simple and easy to understand
- Much easier to use.
- Search bars are very effective, but they need quick filter options to make them fast and effective.
- The search box was easy to use, but I found the other designs were fine too. I chose the search box because I am more used to using sites with this function.


### V2 Comments
- Quick filter options give people the opportunity to quickly find the general information they need which will then allow them to search for other related information.
- Easy to use and good it has brexit and covid as topical filters
- It is an attractive design and seems pretty easy to navigate.
