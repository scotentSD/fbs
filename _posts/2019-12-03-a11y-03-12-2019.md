**Audience**
- 6 participants with various range of access needs: Asperger, Dyslexia, visual stress, registered blind, ADHD. NVDA and JAWS users.

**Focus**
- Testing SEP with customer experiencing accessibility issues
- End to End testing
- feedback links on the service page were not tested

**Observations**
Top issues - some are not SEP specific

- Use / over use of tooltips
- Use of list boxes, where users didn’t understand how to interact with them properly
- The reading order of the listings page on a screen reader (You Search and then……no results. Just lots of Filters).
- Tabs: how they are used and what happens with the filtering options when changed
- The business address drop down form (people didn’t know that the manual entry was a selectable option)
- Terminology: browse support vs browse all support / browse vs search / order of info on the find out more buttons
- Framing / design of the search and filters to make it clearer what the user is doing
- Managing the link/jump off to other sites, new pages are opening without warning
- CTA and next steps links on each details page. People didn’t understand the nuances between them or what the partner website meant
- All caps letters for buttons (hard to read when dyslexic) 

In addition there were a number of WCAG 2.1 specific issues which were observed. They need to be fixed as well in order to comply with recent legislation on Public Sector Website Accessibility.
