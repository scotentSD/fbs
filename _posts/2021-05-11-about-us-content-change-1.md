Recently we developed a series of key messages for FBS that explain the site's vision, design and function. This information gives background and context both to the public and to our partners and other stakeholders, who can also use the messages as a reference when speaking about FBS to their own audiences. 

To make sure this information is prominent and easily accessible, we updated the content on the [About Us page](https://findbusinesssupport.gov.scot/about-us) to reflect the new messages. This includes sections on:

- the purpose of the site
- how it can help businesses
- why it was created
- who runs it
- site usage, visitors and newsletter subscribers

The page also still carries a list of our partners and information on the help and complaints processes. 

We subsequently added another short section on the rationale behind the site design and how it improves our green credentials.
