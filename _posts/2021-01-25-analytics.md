## Comparing bounce rates between Sunday 24 and Monday 25
-	Sunday 24 January: 41%
-	Monday 25 January: 24%


It’s too early to start looking at trends since the new changes have only been live for less than 24 hours. But it might be of interest to note:
-	60% of visitors left FBS once they got to the ‘old’ advice page
-	For the ‘new’ page, this has dropped to 32%.

The lower percentage could mean visitors are more likely to stay on FBS.
Warning: The fact that it's a Sunday compared to Monday might add other factors than just the redesign.
