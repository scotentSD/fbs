**Audience**
- Partners

**Focus**
Refine the initial findings from the initial workshop
- Services content management (partner portal)
- Enquiry handling

**Observations**
Refined needs
They all want minimal disruption from their actual ways of working, so:

- Enquiries direct in their CRM
- Events in their event provider to be fetch via API and added to SEP automatically
- Ideally no duplication of product content sources
- Knowledge base was not really something they wanted to use, and were happy not to have access to it. They would just use the SEP website as their knowledge base
