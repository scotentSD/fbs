## Audience
- Unmoderated testing via UserZoom 50 users

## Audience
One-to-one testing via Teams

- 6 business owners
- 3 male, 2 female

## Focus
- Share four difference screenshots of the FBS site with different top-level menu to see which one they prefer

## Summary of insights

- Most people couldn't see any significant difference between the four menus
- No clear-cut winner â€“ not much difference between the four

## Recommendations
- Users don't have strong feelings about the menu
- When users did comment on liking a specific option, they mentioned the one with 'Coronavirus' and 'Brexit' (screenshot 4)
- It might be more useful to do an A/B test once the site is live with two options to see if it has any impact on how often the coronavirus and Brexit pages get clicked on from the homepage
