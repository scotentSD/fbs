## Audience
One-to-one testing via Teams

- Two business owners (tourism and retail)
- One FBS partner
- One male, Two female


## Focus
- What challenges have they faced when accessing Covid funding?
- Can they find relevant funding? Where would they look first?
- Where do they expect to see upcoming funds on the site?
- Do they want to see closed funds on the site?
- How would they expect to see funds categorised?
- What would they do if they couldn't find any funding for their business?
- Would they want to see general guidance about applying for funding?

## Summary of insights

### Challenges
- The government announces funds with large numbers, but when it's divided up it isn't much for the individual businesses
- Criteria needs to be more transparent
- A newly self-employed business without premises was unable to get any funding, and taking on premises is too risky right nowd
- Funds get announced but then they can't find any information about them

### Can they find relevant funding? Where would they look first?
- Two used the accordions, one used the CTA button
- None noticed the text link to more funding

### Do they want to see upcoming funds on the site? Where would they expect to find them
- All said they wanted to see upcoming funds
- Most would expect to see them in the Browse support section - they scrolled down to the upcoming funds section on the advice page but didn’t really notice it

### Do they want to see closed funds on the site? Where would they expect to see them?
- All users said no:
- "If they're closed, they're of no use to me"
- "It's not worth the resource to look into them if they're not going to open again"

### How would they expect to see funds categorised?
 - All said it would be useful to distinguish between grants and loans
 
### What would you do if you came to the site and couldn't find any funding?
 -One would contact their MP
- One would just try to earn money through their business
- One would go to the contact us page and phone – they wouldn't use the form because it doesn't tell you how long it will take for someone to respond

### Would you want to see guidance about applying for funding?
- "It's a bit text heavy"
- Would maybe look at the FAQs or top tips
- It's helpful to see what is needed for funding, but they would get their accountant to help

### What might help
- Bullet point the criteria – keep it simple
- Keep open communication between businesses and government
- A tool where you could input your business details and it tells you which funds you're eligible for
- Including filters for size of business or location
- Adding the closing date (or making it clear that there is no closing date) to service descriptions

## Summary
- Users don't notice the text link to all funding under the accordions
- Add the closing date (or make it clear that there is no closing date) to service descriptions
- Make upcoming funds more prominent on the advice page so users don't miss them
- Funding guide may be of limited use to businesses that are experienced in accessing grant funding or get accountants/intermediaries to do it for them
