We looked at what links were the most used on [the main coronavirus advice page](https://findbusinesssupport.gov.scot/coronavirus-advice) between the 6 and 19 January 2021.

Out of the 185 links on this page, **32 were responsible for 90% of the traffic**.

(PDF below illustrate this with green stickies for the 'high traffic' links. yellow stickies for the others)

In parallel we also removed links to resources which were now out of date (things are moving fast!) or not as relevant anymore.


Most of the links in the top 32 are supports (nearly all funding) which customers can find from the 'Browse support' page.
So these links have been removed from the main coronavirus advice page as a new design (testing with customers at the moment) will allow to get the results for **Coronavirus support**  or **Coronavirus advice** at the top of the page.
