## Phase
- Live

## Audience
- UserTesting Generic Panel * 15 people

## We were focusing on 
Test new filter types and categories with the users and understand if these will work for them. 
Do this as a Closed Card Sort whih gives people categories and asks them to place items into them 
Follow this up with an Open Card Sort where people can chosse their own groupings

We explored the following things: 

- What information would the users provide about their company in order to find support
- If the filter category's make sense? 
- If the items listed under each of the filter category's make sense? 
- Thoughts on the language used for categories 
- If there was anything missing from the filter categories or the items under the categories.
- The order of the filter categories that users would like to see when filtering

## We proposed
- What industry are you in?
- Where is your organisation based?
- What type of organisation are you?
- What are you looking for support with?
- How would you like your support delivered?


## What we discovered
- They worked wuite well for users 



## What we discovered 

| Learning

|All users were able to successfully complete the card sort exercises with ease.
|They categorized the items in the same way as the proposed solution (mostly, but with some overlap)
|Filter categories and the items within them made sense to all the users
|‚ÄùHow would you like your support delivered?‚Äù category was less clear to the users 
|‚Äù What are you looking for support with?‚Äù filter category was the most important filter in terms of order of preference 
|Overall, users found the language used for this exercise easy and straightforward
|When asked about the information the users would provide public sector to receive support  following things were shared: their company details such as name, vat no, size, turnover, company description to issues that they were facing and the help that they wanted such as loan.

| Everything was clear but I was unsure about the ‚ÄòOutwith Scotland' 
| Where items can be placed in to two categories: Education, training as an example, give the option for them to sit within both.
| I would have to say that some of these were a bit vague but overall, It wasn't that difficult for me to sort them in groups once I started working on this task
