## Audience
Intermediaries testing via Teams, 6 participants

## Summary of insights

### Where they go for Covid advice
- They tend to use push notifications and spend less time actively looking for information
- None mentioned FBS
- Sources include newsletters, peers, industry bodies, Google, UK Gov

### Page layout and content
- Plain and easy to use
- Upcoming funds are more important than news/updates
- "Search all available funding' accordion distracted from the two above (This has now been changed to "Search all other available funding")
- Closing dates on funds would be welcome
- Phone number should be prominently displayed
- More information should be at the top of the page
- Upcoming funds should be a filter option in Browse support
- No interest in closed funds

## Summary
- They are using a variety of push sources of information (newsletters, email alerts, etc)
- The top (accordion) options were everyone's first choice
- "Grants" is our language and not necessarily business speak
- Lifestyle and household issues are impacting work practices - flexibility is a competitive advantage
- Future funding is of interest
- Strategic Framework funding took an early reputational hit due to inconsistent delivery and low approval rates
- Technology inequities (capabiltiy and experience) are making communication harder for some businesses
- Phone and email preferred over live chat
