## Audience
One-to-one testing via Teams

- Three business owners, all male
- One in the creative sector
- Two in food and drink

## Focus
- What do users think of the layout and appearance of this page? [https://findbusinesssupport.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-c](https://findbusinesssupport.gov.scot/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-c) (You can [see a screenshot of that page](/sep/files/httpsfindbusinesssupport.gov.scotcoronavirus-covid-19-advice-c.jpg) when tested)
- Can they find relevant funding?
- Do they want to see upcoming funds on the site?
- Do they want to see closed funds on the site?

## Summary of insights

### What worked:
- Users like the clean, uncluttered layout
- The Funding and Guidance buttons were used by all
- Last updated dates on service descriptions were appreciated
- Highlighting funds for business rates payers/self-employed -"This splits it quite clearly"

### What didn't work
- The cookie banner covered the fold, so not all users saw that there was more content below​
- The content below the fold had no headings and was hard to scan
- Technical issue with the browse support search bar for the user on a Mac

### Can they find relevant funding?
- All users eventually went to the Funding button on the advice page, but two went to read guidance first
- One user used the sector filter, one used search and the other just scrolled

### Do they want to see upcoming funds on the site?
- Two said yes, one was more focused on closed funds
- Time to prepare for an upcoming fund application was important

### Do they want to see closed funds on the site?
- Mixed feedback - one said no, another said yes, another said if they were there, they should be clearly highlighted

## Recommendations
- Keep the layout simple and uncluttered
- Retain Funding and Guidance buttons at the top
- List upcoming funding and grants – more research may be needed on the best way to do this
- Tweak the layout so the cookie banner doesn’t cover the fold
- Add opening and closing dates to service descriptions
- See if we can make better use of email alerts
