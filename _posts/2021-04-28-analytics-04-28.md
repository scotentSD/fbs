We looked at the analytics for the [Covid page](https://findbusinesssupport.gov.scot/coronavirus-advice) for the last month.
Over 56% of pageviews are for ‘browse support’ after visiting the Advice page in the past 2 months. This is good we want them to go there.

## What the analytics tells us for the past month

- the 'Coronavirus funding' button has only had 0.22% of pageviews (26)
- the 'Coronavirus guidance' button has had 0.05% of pageviews (6)
- most users are going to 'browse support' - 'browse support' has had 72.36% of pageviews (8,479)
- the homepage link has been more popular than the 2 buttons (homepage - 1.58% of pageviews (185))
- even the ‘Quick Guide’ has had more pageviews from the Covid advice page (1,07% of pageviews, 125 pageviews) (Note: it's the last link on the page)
- users have been ignoring the buttons and/or these topics are possibly not the priority for users anymore

## What we decided based on this
- the buttons are at the best place (high on the page) so they are unlikely to get better use elsewhere on the page so we removed them
- Latest updates has been moved up
