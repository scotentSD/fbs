### Bounce rate - improved!
Cut by half (was 44% and now down to 23% last week).
It means people are more likely to engage with the site than leave after landing on the advice page.

### New quick guide to coronavirus (Covid-19) business support
Since Friday, 45% of users who come to the [‘quick guide’](https://findbusinesssupport.gov.scot/coronavirus-advice/quick-guide-to-business-support) leave the website there. This could mean:
- The page is not working because nearly half of users who get to it leave FBS, rather that engage with the site
- Or these users have already found the info they were looking for and this guide has not given them new info

To monitor, but it looks like this page might not be working.

### Sign up for email
More people are cliking on it and registering which is good as it's the best way for customers to be updated.
