**Audience**
- Partners from BG, HIE and SDS, members of the delivery team who were the most involved with the partners

**Focus**

To reflect on the work we have done with the partners these last months on SEP to improve the way we work together
-	what worked well
-	what didnâ€™t
-	what we should stop/start doing


**Summary of insights**
- Playbacks/standups/demos were overwhelmingly positively viewed
- Partner working was also very positive
- Can we think of a way to collaborate more? Have regular face to face sessions with partners
- Workstream approach was broadly positive but we need better communication between workstreams and a clear understanding of their roles
- User-centred design approach is good but we should make use of existing research from partners
- We delivered for Beta but we need a shared vision and roadmap for future development
- The D1 assessment is a good approach and should be embraced as a methodology
- Transparency could and should be much greater
- Communication could be much better and we should consider alternative platforms (eg MS Teams)
- Prioritisation could be improved
- We should reconsider our delivery model
- A lack of dedicated resource for the next phase of SEP could be a blocker
