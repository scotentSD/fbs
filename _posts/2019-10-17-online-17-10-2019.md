**Audience**


**Focus**
- Home page images

**Observations**
- Most people are fairly indifferent to the homepage image
- There is a slight bias towards one of the new images but not enough to really justify changing it
- White text on top of image is still not ideal
- ps. They are not really that bothered about the grey footer, even though it looks a bit dull
