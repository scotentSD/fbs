## Customer Quotes
- Because when you're looking for events, I don't think that most people would automatically free type search for a particular event so having location up is good.
- I think it's a very good idea to put the location on the date range further up at the top.
- Easy to find the links to the most important information resources from other sites
- As a business owner, it provides all the right information i require in a straight tothe point fashion and navigates me to the right places to find that info which is great. As the Gov.uk site can be hard to navigate
-	I searched for restaurants.  Perhaps travel and hospitality?
-	No other suggestions, it seems comprehensive
