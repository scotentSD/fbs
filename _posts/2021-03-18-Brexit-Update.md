## Audience
- 4 potential customers, using Video calls (Microsoft Teams)

## What we tested
- [The Operate after Brexit page](https://findbusinesssupport.gov.scot/operate-after-brexit)

## Focus
- What challenges are businesses facing around trying to operate after Brexit?
- Where would businesses go for information about operating a business after Brexit?
- What do users think of the content and layout of the page?
- Is there anything missing from the page?
- What would users do if they came to this page and couldn't find the information that they needed?

## Summary of insights

- People like that there is a link to FAQs but they want more detail (which you can get on SE.com)
- No one commented on the Funding/Events buttons – they aren’t getting down far enough on the page
- People like the SE.com Brexit pages in terms of the content, style and layout but are less keen on FBS
- A few people mentioned that they would expect to see a list of sectors in the ‘Advice for specific sectors’ accordion
- Someone also suggested adding more information about the funding support to that accordion section
- Everyone expects there to be a search bar
- There’s some confusion around the Brexit filter on the homepage only linking to a page with three items, instead of the whole Brexit page

## Recommendations
- Send users directly to SE.com
- Add a list of sectors to the 'Advice for specific sectors' section
- Add some more context around what funding support is available to the 'Financial support' section
- Add a search bar to the top navigation
- Review the usefulness of the Brexit filter on the homepage through analytics
